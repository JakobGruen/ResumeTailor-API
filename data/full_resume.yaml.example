# RESUME CONFIGURATION FILE
# ========================================
# This file defines your complete resume data according to the ResumeTailor schema.
# Fill in your information following the structure below.
#
#
# REQUIRED vs OPTIONAL fields:
# - Fields marked with "# REQUIRED" must be filled
# - Fields marked with "# OPTIONAL" can be omitted or set to `null`
# - Some sections can be entirely omitted if not applicable (omit by setting to `section: null`)
#
#
# IMPORTANT: Maintain the YAML structure and indentation!
# For YAML syntax help, see: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html
#
#
# TIPS FOR FILLING YOUR RESUME:
#
# 1. ADD MAXIMUM DETAIL: Include as much information as possible - the AI will filter what's relevant for each job
# 2. DON'T WORRY ABOUT SOUNDING GOOD: Use simple bullet points, keywords, or basic descriptions - AI will polish the language
# 3. INCLUDE EVERYTHING: Add all skills, experiences, projects, even if they seem minor - you never know what might be relevant
# 4. USE SIMPLE LANGUAGE: Basic descriptions are fine (e.g., "used Python for data analysis" vs crafted prose)
# 5. ADD NUMBERS/METRICS: Include any quantifiable results, even rough estimates (e.g., "improved by ~20%", "managed 5 people")
# 6. LIST ALL TECHNOLOGIES: Include every tool, framework, language you've used, even briefly
# 7. DON'T SELF-FILTER: Let the AI decide what's relevant - include experiences from different industries/roles
# 8. BE FACTUAL ONLY: Focus on what you actually did, not how impressive it sounds
#
# Remember: This is RAW DATA for the AI to process - completeness matters more than polish!
# The AI will tailor, refine, and make everything sound professional for specific jobs.
