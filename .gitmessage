# Subject line (50 chars max) - use imperative mood
# |<----   Preferably under 50 chars   ---->|

# Blank line separates subject from body

# Body: Explain what and why (wrap at 72 chars)
# |<----   Try to limit each line to 72 characters   ---->|
# - Use bullet points for multiple changes
# - Focus on the "what" and "why", not the "how"
# - Reference issues/tickets if applicable

# Add retry mechanism for OpenAI rate limits
# Fix memory leak in session management
# Update documentation for deployment
# Remove deprecated authentication methods

# BREAKING CHANGE: describe the breaking change

# For conventional commits (optional):
# feat: add new feature
# fix: bug fix
# docs: documentation changes
# style: code style changes (formatting, etc)
# refactor: code refactoring
